# basta
Making a virtual game of the popular Mexican game, Basta

# Summary
I was previously making this web application using Angular, but decided it was too heavy for this type of project. So, I decided
to switch to React for Frontend and Nodejs for backend.

# Tools Used
* React - Frontend
* Nodejs/express - backend
* socket.io - to communicate with backend and frontend
